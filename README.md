# CampMyTrip

*Figure 1. Number of campgrounds in the ReserveAmerica database within 25km of U.S. Interstate Highways.*  
Campground locations are indicated by grey triangles while interstates are colored by the number of campgrounds. Distances from highways to campgrounds were calculated directly and not via roads.  


*Figure 2. Campgrounds mid-route from my home (San Francisco, CA) to my in-laws (Corvallis, OR).*  
Figure shows the distance of the campground from my home and the extra time it would take to drive there. Campgrounds are colored by the operating agency.
